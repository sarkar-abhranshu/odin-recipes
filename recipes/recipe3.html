        <li>2 g turmeric powder</li>
        <li>Â½ tsp kashmiri red chilli powder</li>
        <li>5 green chillies</li>
        <li>60 g tomato</li>
        <li>200 g potatoes (halved and boiled)</li>
        <li>12 g sugar</li>
        <li>22 g salt</li>
        <li>650 g hot water</li>
        <li>1 pinch shahi garam masala</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make regular, pan-fried omelettes, beat together eggs, salt, sliced onions, chopped green chillies, and chopped ginger. Heat mustard oil in a skillet. Once hot, ladle the egg mixture and place dollops of mashed potatoes at even intervals. When the first side has fried, flip over and fry the other side. Repeat with the remaining egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Slice onions. Paste garlic and ginger separately. Roughly chop tomatoes. Halve the potatoes and boil them.</li>
        <li>Heat mustard oil in a kadai until it smokes gently.</li>
        <li>Temper with dried red chillies, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin seeds.</li>
        <li>Add sliced onions. Add some sugar to brown the onion. Mix and fry on medium heat until onions are brown (about 8 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add ginger paste and green chillies. Fry for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garlic paste. For for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add roughly chopped tomatoes. Cook until tomatoes are soft (about 6 minutes).</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, Kashmiri red chilli powder with some water. Pour this spice mix into the kadai.</li>
        <li>Add salt and keep frying until the raw smell of the spices goes away (about 12 minutes). If the mixture dries out, add a splash of hot water and continue frying.</li>
        <li>When oil starts to separate from the spices, add boiled potatoes.</li>
        <li>Add hot water to form the curry. Don't worry if the curry looks a bit watery at this point; the omelette will absorb most of the liquid.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid comes to a boil, add the omelettes. Add more slit green chillies.</li>
        <li>Bubble on medium heat until the curry thickens. This will take around 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some shahi garam masala, cover the pan and allow it to rest.</li>
    </ol>
